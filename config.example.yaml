# Projects to exclude (optional)
# List project names or paths that should be excluded from monitoring

# GitLab servers configuration

      # You can also use project path instead of ID
      - path: "group/project-name"

  # Example 2: Monitor entire groups
  - name: "GitLab Production"
    url: "https://gitlab.com"
    token: "your-gitlab-token-here"
    groups:
      # Monitor all projects in a group by path

      # Or by group ID

# Cache TTL (Time To Live) configuration in seconds
# Adjust these values based on your needs:
# - Lower values: More frequent updates, higher API usage
# - Higher values: Less frequent updates, lower API usage
cache:
  # Groups/Projects cache TTL (default: 1800s = 30 minutes)
  # Project structure changes rarely, so a longer TTL is recommended
  groupsProjects: 1800
  # Branches cache TTL (default: 300s = 5 minutes)
  # Branches are created/deleted occasionally
  branches: 300
  # Pipeline status cache TTL (default: 5s)
  # Pipeline status changes frequently, so a short TTL keeps data fresh
  pipelines: 5

# Display options
display:
  # Show only branches with recent activity (default: false)
  recentOnly: false
  # Number of pipelines to show per branch (default: 1)
  pipelinesPerBranch: 1
  # Compact mode (less spacing, default: false)
  compact: false
